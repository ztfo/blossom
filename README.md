# Blossom ðŸŒ¸

**Blossom** is a fun and interactive web app designed to teach users how to recognize and use the schwa rule in spelling. Inspired by the metaphor of "calling your dog in for dinner," users complete word challenges by filling in the missing vowels in words with schwa sounds.

This app was created for a family member who is a speech pathologist working with dyslexic children.
